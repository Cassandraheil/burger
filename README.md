# Burger

## What is this project?
* This project allows a user to order a burger and devour it! 

## Why is it useful
*  Creating this app has allowed me to practice my skills working with many different tools. Tools such as mySQL Workbench, Node, Express, and Express Handlebars. Bringing all these useful resources together and deploying them on Heroku really expanded my coding skills and is a good base to improve on.

## How can users get started with this app?
* Using this app is simple. The user can type in the name of the burger they would like to order in the box that says 'order a unigue burger'. Once submitted the burger will show up on the left side. the user can choose to devour the burger simply by hitting the devour button beside the selected burger.
